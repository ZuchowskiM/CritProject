Introduction

	Before we start this review, I would like to let everyone know that I played different MOBA from PC, Console and Mobile. And yes I can say I'm a bit competitive but I myself is a gamer in nature so I enjoy every detail that a game comes with.

The first Mobile MOBA that I played was Vain of Glory but the tap mechanics wasn't my thing back in 2015. Then here comes Arena of Valor (TW Server) back in 2016. The game gave me an idea that in the near future we could (and now we do) have a LoL Mobile. A lot of MOBA is out in Mobile, but Gameplay wise I think AoV/Honor of Kings was the one who set the bars on how MOBA should be in Mobile.

Gameplay

	Wild Rift starts by confirming wether you have experience playing League PC or nah. And if this is your first time playing League or not the Tutorial gives you ample idea of how the game works and it's appeal on how the skill shots, auto attack works. I would say that the feel of using skills in game is something too close to PC Version the only difference? Two Sticks Mechanic but that's it.
From Auto Attack -> Move, I can really say that this is the LoL Mobile that we are all waiting for.
The "Pace" of the game is fast but faster than League PC. I don't get the hate that the game is getting for it being "slow" in pace but in reality it really depends on your Game Style. I mainly play Jungle or Solo Top, and I can say that it felt the same way playing in Summoner's Rift!
